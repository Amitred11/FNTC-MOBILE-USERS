    question: 'My internet is slow or not working. What should I do?',
    answer: `We're sorry you're experiencing issues. Please try these initial troubleshooting steps, as they resolve most common problems:

1.  **Restart Your Router:** Unplug your Wi-Fi router from the power outlet, wait for at least 30 seconds, and then plug it back in. Wait for 2-3 minutes for all indicator lights on the router to stabilize.
2.  **Check Cables:** Ensure all cables (power, Ethernet, fiber optic) connected to your router and the wall outlet are securely plugged in and not damaged.
3.  **Check for Outages:** If you can access our website on mobile data, visit our Facebook page or ask me "Is there a service outage in my area?" (if the chatbot is online) to check for known service interruptions.

If these steps do not resolve your issue, please contact our technical support team for further assistance.`,
