## Agreement to Terms
Welcome to FiBear Network Technologies Corp. ("Fibear", "we", "us", "our"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the internet services, mobile application, and any related services (collectively, the "Service") provided by Fibear. By creating an account, accessing, or using our Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Service.

## Description of Service
Fibear provides high-speed internet access to residential and business customers. The specific details of your service plan, including but not limited to speed, data allowances, and price, are outlined in the plan you selected upon subscription. Service availability is not guaranteed and may be affected by factors outside of our control, such as network maintenance, geographic location, and equipment limitations.

## Payments, Billing, and Subscription
You agree to pay all charges associated with your selected service plan in a timely manner. Billing cycles are typically monthly, and your first bill will be generated upon activation of your Service. Failure to pay your bill by the due date may result in a late fee, service suspension, or termination of your account. All payments are non-refundable, except as expressly stated in our policies or as required by law.

## User Conduct and Acceptable Use
You are responsible for all activity that occurs on your internet connection. You agree not to use the Service for any unlawful or prohibited activities, including but not limited to:
* Transmitting any material that is illegal, defamatory, abusive, or obscene.
* Violating intellectual property rights, including copyrights and trademarks.
* Distributing viruses, malware, or other harmful computer code.
* Engaging in activities that disrupt or degrade the network or the experience of other users, such as network spamming or denial-of-service attacks.
* Reselling the Service or providing access to third parties outside of your household without our express written consent.
Violation of these acceptable use policies may result in immediate suspension or termination of your Service.

## Equipment
Any equipment provided by Fibear (such as modems or routers) remains the property of Fibear. You agree to protect the equipment from damage and not to modify, tamper with, or attempt to repair it. Upon termination of your Service, you must return all Fibear-owned equipment in good working condition. Failure to do so may result in charges for the replacement cost of the equipment.

## Limitation of Liability
The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. Fibear does not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure. In no event shall Fibear, its directors, employees, or partners be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising out of your use of or inability to use the Service.

## Termination
You may request to cancel your Service at any time through the mobile application. Cancellation will take effect at the end of your current billing period. Fibear reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Service immediately and without notice for any violation of these Terms, including non-payment or breach of the acceptable use policy.

## Changes to Terms
We may modify these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms within the application and updating the "Last updated" date. Your continued use of the Service after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.
